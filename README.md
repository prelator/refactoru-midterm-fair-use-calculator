RefactorU Midterm Project for Patrick McKay

This project is a fair use calculator and copyright dispute generator, eventually intended to be part of my website, FairUseTube.org. 

When a YouTube user has a video flagged for copyright infringement, they can go through the questionnaire to determine if their video likely qualifies as fair use under US copyright law. 

If it does, the program will automatically generate concise text for them to cut and paste into the various text-area fields in YouTube's different copyright dispute forms, allowing them to dispute the false copyright claim on their video.
